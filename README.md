# NLP Individual Research Project

My individual final project for Georgia Tech's graduate natural language processing class in Spring 2021. The objective was to determine if character level embeddings/tokens were viable when compared to word level embeddings/tokens. The dataset used is from Kaggle's Toxic Comment Classification Challenge https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge. From the amount of experimentation conducted, it seems suffice to say that character embeddings are viable if not on par with word embeddings.
