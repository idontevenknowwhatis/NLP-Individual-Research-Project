# NLP Individual Research Project

My individual final project for Georgia Tech's graduate natural language processing class. The objective was to determine if character level embeddings/tokens were viable when compared to word level embeddings/tokens. The dataset used is from Kaggle's Toxic Comment Classification Challenge https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge
